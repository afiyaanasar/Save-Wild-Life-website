# Save-Wild-Life-website
This project is a basic informational website designed to promote awareness about wildlife conservation and the protection of endangered animals. It was developed using HTML for structure, CSS for layout and styling, and JavaScript for basic interactivity. As my first academic project, it helped me learn fundamental web development concepts.
